**System Architecture Overview**

The deepfake detection pipeline consists of several integrated components working together:

-Video Input & Frame Extraction - Processing input videos and extracting individual frames

-Face Detection & Preprocessing - Using MTCNN or MediaPipe to detect and align faces

-Feature Extraction - CNN models (XceptionNet, EfficientNet, ResNet) extract visual features

-Temporal Analysis - LSTM/RNN networks analyze sequences for temporal inconsistencies

-Classification - Binary classification determining Real vs Fake

-Ensemble Methods - Combining multiple models for improved accuracy

**Key Technical Components**

<br>

1. Face Detection & Preprocessing
   
Modern deepfake detection relies heavily on robust face detection. The most effective approaches use:

-MTCNN (Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Networks): Provides high-accuracy face detection with landmarks

-MediaPipe: Google's efficient face detection solution

-Face Alignment: Standardizing face orientation and size for consistent analysis

<br>

2. Feature Extraction Models
   
Research shows that different CNN architectures excel at different aspects:

-XceptionNet: Achieves 95-97% accuracy on benchmark datasets, particularly effective with depthwise separable convolutions

-EfficientNet: Provides excellent efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, commonly used in production systems

-ResNet architectures: Serve as reliable baselines and work well in ensemble methods

<br>

3. Temporal Analysis
   
Video-based deepfake detection requires analyzing temporal inconsistencies:

-LSTM Networks: Capture long-term dependencies in video sequences

-RNN Variants: Process frame sequences to identify temporal artifacts

-CNN+LSTM Combinations: Extract spatial features with CNNs, then analyze temporal patterns with LSTMs

<br>

4. Ensemble Methods
   
Research consistently shows that ensemble approaches achieve the highest accuracy:

-Model Diversity: Combining different architectures (CNN, LSTM, Transformers)

-Voting Strategies: Majority voting, weighted averaging, stacking

-Cross-Dataset Generalization: Improved performance on unseen data
